# BTFS Web UI Usability Testing

The app should make the following actions **easy** to complete

- Add a file and share it with a friend
- See the files in your repository
- Determine if the node is connected to the network and operating normally
- Diagnose when your BTFS daemon isn't running and fix it
- Find the peer ID of the node you are connected to
- Find IPLD info about an BTFS path and browse a link

More holistically, it should give a feeling of being connected to a network of peers.
It must not give a sense of "uploading to the cloud", as that is a significant cause
of confusion about how BTFS works, and it's dangerously misleading.

The app should make the following actions **possible** to complete

- Determine the peer ID of the node
- Determine how it is connected to BTFS
- Find which network addresses it's bound to

## Goal of the usability test

- Find any problems prevent any of the participants from completing the tasks
- Gather structured feedback on the v2 redesign

## Methods

- 45 min interview with PL folk, some developers, some not.
- Notes, no recording
- Remote or in-person
